# C++ Source Code for Hough Transform on Android Device


Contents:

Android-App directory - contains code and gradle scripts to build app

fpmath directory - imported fixed point math library, only used in testing, not in final app

text files - contain outputs of each stage

Notes:

input image will consist of ASCII characters

Each byte is a two-character sequence from '00' to 'FF'

Need to read in each of these characters and convert to unsigned char
